Kalpeesh: Grocery data scraping project; faced challenges with scale & performance. Plan to use cloud (Google VMs/AWS/Databricks) for faster, cheaper processing.

Siza & Kamal: presented the idea of Customer review analyzer  project(cross-platform reviews, sentiment analysis, Power BI dashboards, real-time alerts).                                                                                                                                                                           Feedback: clarify problem statement, ensure uniqueness vs. Google tools, focus on scalability.

Collaboration
Kalpeesh to collaborate with Harman (DevOps), Vedanti & Parth (data engineering), others for data science support.
Group proposed dedicated Web Scraping Learning Session (Selenium, APIs, BeautifulSoup, etc.).

Key Suggestions from Sahil
Speak up – share struggles for effective guidance.
Always start presentations with a clear problem statement.
Be concise – problem → target audience → solution → outcome.
Leverage cloud/big data tools (Databricks, AWS Glue, Spark).
Use community expertise – collaborate across skills (DevOps, data engineering, data science).
Practice structured pitching – capture attention in first 20–30 seconds.

3,8/22/2025,Industry Professional Session,"Key Points from the Session

Session Focus
• Understanding prompt engineering as communication with LLMs — an iterative process to get better results.
• Explored not just prompts themselves but also model configurations (temperature, top-p, top-k, output length).
• Hands-on demos in AI Studio and Colab, showing how prompts, context, and settings influence outputs.

Prompting Techniques Covered
• Zero-shot, One-shot, Few-shot – moving from no examples to multiple examples for better direction.
• Role & System Prompting – assigning the model a role or setting system instructions to anchor context.
• Contextual Prompting – provide relevant (not excessive) context for accuracy and efficiency.
• Step-Back & Chain-of-Thought – encourage reasoning steps before answering directly.
• Self-Consistency – running reasoning multiple times and trusting the majority output.
• Tree of Thoughts – exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously for complex tasks.
• ReAct (Reason + Act) – combining reasoning with external tools (e.g., search, code execution).
• Code Prompting – using LLMs for code generation, debugging, and explanation.

Best Practices
• Be specific with word choice, tone, and structure.
• Always state the format you want outputs in (JSON, tables, emojis, etc.).
• Use constraints explicitly (what the model should and shouldn’t do).
• Document prompt attempts — iterate, compare, and refine.
• Balance creativity vs reliability with temperature/top-p settings depending on use case.

Community Highlights
• Great peer examples shared on AI Studio, Gemini Pro vs Flash, and API/Colab integration.
• Real-world ideas surfaced — e.g., building a resume analyzer using in-context prompting.

📌 Next Steps
• Try experimenting with temperature and top-p settings in your own projects.
• Explore advanced prompting patterns (Step-Back, ToT, ReAct) for complex tasks.
• Consider documenting and sharing your prompt experiments in the community.

The session was a “Future-Proofing Skill Tree” activity.
Participants selected their target roles (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Product Manager, DevOps/Cloud, Software Engineer).
Using a collaborative board, they mapped current and future-proof skills for each role.
Breakout rooms were created for small group discussions, and then everyone regrouped to share insights.

🔑 Skills Identified as Future-Proof
